Motion chart, fix field names so data is passed through correctly
=================================================================
- Previously, looked up the the "real" field name, returning eg. field_date_value, but this no longer matches $view->style_plugin->rendered_fields[$j] lookup, which is now using eg. field_date. So remove "real" name lookup, pass in field_date directly rather than field_date_value.

Motion chart, date fixes
========================
- Patch: gvs-date_fixes.patch
#1 - Month and days mixed up
- PHP's strtotime (line 487) assumes a date with "-" separator in eu format d-m-Y (see http://goo.gl/SKwnF)
- but configuration asks for m-d-Y format, so months and days are mixed up
- so: use Y-m-d format instead, update documentation to match
#2 - Month minus one
- For an unknown reason, the month is reduced by one on line 485
- Removed
